## 2. The Pillars of Gameplay

Success requires mastering four types of magic (mathematics).

### 🦶 Movement (Addition & Subtraction)
*   **Goal**: Travel distance in your active Tome (Chapter).
*   **How to Play**: Solve a sequence of addition or subtraction problems.
*   **Reward**: XP and Distance.
*   **Why?**: To reach the Boss at the end of the Tome and unlock new worlds.

### ⚔️ Combat (Multiplication)
*   **Goal**: Defeat enemies blocking your path or earn Gold.
*   **How to Play**:
    *   **Normal Enemies**: You have a time limit to answer questions. Correct answers deal damage.
    *   **Bosses**: A timer counts down continuously! Answer correctly to fill your **Action Gauge**. When full, you attack automatically.
*   **Reward**: XP and **Gold**.
*   **Why?**: You need Gold to buy research items and upgrade companions.

### 🔍 Research (Division)
*   **Goal**: Unlock magical chests to find equipment.
*   **How to Play**:
    1.  Spend **Gold** to enter.
    2.  Select a Chest (Rarity depends on luck).
    3.  Solve a division puzzle to break the lock.
*   **Reward**: **Items** (Equipment).
*   **Why?**: Items make you stronger (more HP, Attack, or Gold gain).

### 🧪 Alchemy (Fractions)
*   **Goal**: Craft consumable potions.
*   **How to Play**: Spend **Nems** (obtained by melting unwanted items) to draft a recipe, then solve fraction problems to brew it.
*   **Reward**: Potions (Healing, Buffs).

## 4. Character Growth

### Stats
*   **❤️ HP**: Health Points. If this reaches 0, you lose the battle. Increases with Level.
*   **⚔️ Attack**: How much damage you deal to monsters. Increases with Level and Items.

*   **🦶 Agility**: Bonus movement speed. Increases every 3 Levels.

### Equipment & Inventory
1.  Click the **"Backpack"** icon (bottom left) or the **"Details"** button on your stat widget.
2.  Drag and drop items from your **Backpack** into the numbered **Active Slots**.
    *   *Note*: Slots 4, 5, and 6 are locked until you reach levels 5, 10, and 15!
3.  Different items give different bonuses (e.g., "Scholar" items give more XP, "Fighter" items give more Attack).

### Companions
You are not alone!
1.  Click the **"Companions"** icon (bottom left or in profile).
2.  **Select** a companion to aid you. They provide passive bonuses (e.g., *Fib the Thief* grants extra gold).
3.  **Level Up**: Use your Gold to train your companion. Higher levels mean stronger bonuses!
    *   Level 2: 150g
    *   Level 3: 450g
    *   Level 4: 1,200g
    *   Level 5: 3,000g

## 5. Tips for Survival
*   **Stuck on a Boss?** Go back to previous levels to grind Combat for Gold. Use that Gold to find better items in Research.
*   **Need Healing?** Leveling up fully restores your HP.
*   **Too many items?** Visit the **Black Mirror** (top right of Inventory) to melt common items into Nems for Alchemy.
